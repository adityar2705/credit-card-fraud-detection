Developed a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection using Python and Pandas. Preprocessed and analyzed a large-scale credit card transaction dataset, engineered relevant features, and applied advanced classification algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. Deployed the model as a web application using Streamlit, enabling easy access and real-time fraud monitoring.
